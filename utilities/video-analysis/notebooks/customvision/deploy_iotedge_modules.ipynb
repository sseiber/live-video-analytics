    "    a. If it is the first time using the IoT Hub service that was created in the previous sections, VSCode will ask you to enter the \"IoT Hub Connection String\". You can use the value of the \"IOT_HUB_CONN_STRING\" key, which can be located in the .env file. This command will open a window on top edge of the VSCode and will ask for the IoT Edge device name that you want to use make this deployment. Since you entered the IoT Hub connection string, it will automatically find names of applicable devices and list them for you. For this section, we only have one Edge device, which we named \"lva-sample-device\" when we defined the variables. Select this device in the drop-down list.\n",

    "    ![select edge device](../../../../images/_select_edge_device.png)\n",

    "    b. If you already have a connected IoT Hub in VS Code Azure IoT Hub service, and would like to switch to a different IoT Hub to deploy LVA, you can click \"More Actions\" on the \"AZURE IOT HUB\" panel, and enter your \"IOT_HUB_CONN_STRING\" key.\n",

Right click on the deployment manifest file. In the pop-up menu, click on \"Generate IoT Edge Deployment Manifest\". In this step, VSCode will auto-read the contents of the .env file and use the values of the variables to write over some placeholder variables inside the file. After these replacements, a new version of the file will be placed under the newly created \"config\" folder in the same working directory. \n",

    "6. Depending on your Internet speed, the modules will be pulled from the Cloud and deployed into your Edge device; this process can range from seconds to minutes.
